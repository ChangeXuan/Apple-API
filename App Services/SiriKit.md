# SiriKit
### Handle user requests for your app's services that originate from Siri or Maps.
## 概述
SiriKit encompasses the Intents and Intents UI frameworks, which you use to implement app extensions that integrate your services with Siri and Maps. SiriKit supports two types of app extensions:

- An Intents app extension receives user requests from SiriKit and turns them into app-specific actions. For example, the user might ask Siri to send a message, book a ride, or start a workout using your app.

- An Intents UI app extension displays branding or other customized content in the Siri or Maps interface after your Intents app extension fulfills a user request. Creation of this extension is optional.
