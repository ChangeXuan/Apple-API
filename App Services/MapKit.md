# MapKit
### Display map or satellite imagery directly from your app's interface, call out points of interest, and determine placemark information for map coordinates.
## 概述
Use the MapKit framework to embed maps directly into your own windows and views. You can add annotations and overlays to the map to call out points of interest or user destinations. You can also provide text completion for users typing in the name of a point of interest.

If your app offers transit directions, you can make your directions available to Maps. You can also use Maps to supplement the directions that you provide in your app. For example, if your app only provides directions for subway travel, you can use Maps to provide walking directions to and from subway stations.
