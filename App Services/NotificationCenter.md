# NotificationCenter
### Create and manage widgets.
## 概述
The Notification Center framework helps you create and manage app extensions that implement widgets. The framework provides an API you can use to specify whether a widget has content to display, and to customize aspects of its appearance and behavior. To learn more about creating a widget app extension, see App Extension Programming Guide.

In macOS, the Notification Center framework provides ways to customize the editing and searching experience in a widget.
