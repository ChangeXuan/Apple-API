### Create an app extension that identifies and filters unwanted SMS and MMS messages while preserving user privacy
## 概述
When a user receives an SMS or MMS message from an unknown sender, the Messages app can ask your Message Filter app extension to determine whether the message is unsolicited or otherwise unwanted. Your app extension can make this determination by using its own built-in data and logic or by deferring to analysis done by your associated server.
