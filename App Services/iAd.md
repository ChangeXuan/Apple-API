## 概述
iAd allows your application to earn revenue by displaying advertisements to the user. Your application dedicates a portion of its user interface to display advertisements and in turn you receive revenue when users view or click those advertisements.

While you are developing your application, iAd sends test advertisements to help you verify your implementation is correct. To receive live advertisements from iAd in a release application, you need to integrate the iAd Framework in your application and submit your binary using iTunes Connect.
