# Core Spotlight
### Index the content in apps that handle persistent user data, such as documents and photos, and let users deep-link to it from Spotlight and Safari search results. Add, update, and delete searchable app content.
## 概述
The Core Spotlight framework helps your app participate in search by providing ways to index the content within your app (including user-generated content) and manage the on-device index. Use the APIs of the Core Spotlight framework to add, edit, and remove items from the on-device index.
