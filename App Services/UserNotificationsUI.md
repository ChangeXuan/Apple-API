# UserNotificationsUI
### Customize the interface used to display local and remote notifications.
## 概述
The User Notifications UI framework (UserNotificationsUI.framework) lets you customize the appearance of local and remote notifications when they appear on the user’s device. You use this framework to define an extension that receives the notification data and provides the corresponding visual representation. Your extension can also respond to custom actions associated with those notifications.
