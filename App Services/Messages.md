# Messages
### Create app extensions that interact with the Messages app, allowing users to send text, stickers, media files, and interactive messages. Update interactive messages, adjusting the state of each message as the conversation's participants interact with it.
## 概述
You can use the Messages framework to create two types of app extensions: Sticker packs and iMessage apps. Both extension types can be created as standalone apps or as app extensions within a containing iOS app.
