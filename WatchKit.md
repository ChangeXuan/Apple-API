# WatchKit
### Construct and manage your app’s user interface for watchOS. Respond to events generated by interface objects, gestures, and the system.
## 概述
The WatchKit framework contains the classes that a WatchKit extension uses to manipulate the interface of a watchOS app. A watchOS app contains one or more interface controllers, each of which can have tables, buttons, sliders, and other types of visual elements. The WatchKit extension uses the classes of this framework to configure those visual elements and to respond to user interactions.
