# Game Controller
### Support hardware game controllers in your game.
## 概述
The Game Controller framework is used to discover game controllers connected to a device and receive input data from them. You use control profiles to map the physical controls on the device to the inputs needed in your game. After retrieving a profile from the controller, you can either poll the current values of its controls or add handlers to be called when control values change.
