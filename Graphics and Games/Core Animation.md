# Core Animation
### Render, compose, and animate visual elements.
## 概述
Core Animation provides high frame rates and smooth animations without burdening the CPU and slowing down your app. Most of the work required to draw each frame of an animation is done for you. You configure a few animation parameters (such as the start and end points) and tell Core Animation to start. Core Animation does the rest, handing most of the work off to dedicated graphics hardware to accelerate rendering.
