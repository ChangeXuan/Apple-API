# SpriteKit
### Create 2D sprite-based games using an optimized animation system, physics simulation, and event-handling support.
## 概述
SpriteKit is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure that you can use to animate arbitrary textured images, otherwise known as sprites. SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how those contents change. SpriteKit does the work to render that frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is optimized for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled.
