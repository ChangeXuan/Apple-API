# GLKit
### Speed up OpenGL ES or OpenGL app development. Use math libraries, background texture loading, pre-created shader effects and a standard view and view controller to implement your rendering loop.
## 概述
The GLKit framework provides functions and classes that reduce the effort required to create new shader-based apps or to port existing apps that rely on fixed-function vertex or fragment processing provided by earlier versions of OpenGL ES or OpenGL.
