# SceneKit
### Create 3D games and add 3D content to apps using high-level scene descriptions. Easily add animations, physics simulation, particle effects, and realistic physically based rendering.
## 概述
SceneKit combines a high-performance rendering engine with a descriptive API for import, manipulation, and rendering of 3D assets. Unlike lower-level APIs such as Metal and OpenGL that require you to implement in precise detail the rendering algorithms that display a scene, SceneKit requires only descriptions of your scene’s contents and the actions or animations you want it to perform.
