## 概述
Using the ReplayKit framework, users can record video from the screen, and audio from the app and microphone. They can then share their recordings with other users through email, messages, and social media. You can build app extensions for live broadcasting your content to sharing services. ReplayKit is incompatible with AVPlayer content.
