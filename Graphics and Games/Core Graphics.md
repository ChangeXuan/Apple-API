# Core Graphics
### Harness the power of Quartz technology to perform lightweight 2D rendering with high0fidelity output.Handle path-based drawing, anti-aliased rendering, gradients, images, color management, PDF documents, and more.
## 概述
The Core Graphics framework is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine. It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, and image masking, as well as PDF document creation, display, and parsing.

In macOS, Core Graphics also includes services for working with display hardware, low-level user input events, and the windowing system.
