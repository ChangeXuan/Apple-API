# OpenGL ES
### Create 3D and 2D graphics effects with this compact, efficient subset of OpenGL.
## 概述
OpenGL ES provides a C-based interface for hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics rendering. The OpenGL ES framework (OpenGLES.framework) in iOS provides implementations of versions 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0 of the OpenGL ES specification.

This collection of documents describes the platform-specific APIs for OpenGL ES on iOS devices, also known as EAGL. EAGL provides graphics contexts that encapsulate all OpenGL ES state and the ability to configure a Core Animation layer to be the destination for OpenGL ES drawing commands. EAGL also allows OpenGL ES objects, such as textures, renderbuffers, and framebuffers, to be shared between two or more graphics contexts.
