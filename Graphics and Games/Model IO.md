# Model I/O
### Import, export, and manipulate 3D models using a common infrastructure that integrates MetalKit, GLKit, and SceneKit.
## 概述
The Model I/O framework provides a system-level understanding of 3D model assets and related resources. You can use this framework to import and export assets from and to a variety of industry standard file formats supported by popular authoring tools and game engines. You can also use Model I/O to generate or process model and texture data—for example, to create subdivision surfaces, to bake ambient occlusion textures, or to generate light probes. Model I/O can share data buffers with the MetalKit, GLKit, and SceneKit frameworks to help you load, process, and render 3D assets efficien
