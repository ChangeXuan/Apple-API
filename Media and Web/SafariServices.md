# SafariServices
### Enable web views and services in your app.
## 概述
Use the Safari Services framework to integrate Safari behaviors into your iOS or macOS app or to extend the behavior of Safari. You can:

- Provide a user interface that is almost identical to the user interface provided by the Safari app. Users can browse the web in this view and then return to your app’s content. This view is more consistent with the Safari user interface than implementing your own custom browsing solution and can be done using fewer lines of code. (iOS)

- Add items to the user’s Safari Reading List. (iOS)

- Determine from your app whether your content blocker extension is loaded, and if it is, tell it to refresh its contents. (iOS and macOS)

- Implement Safari app extensions. Determine from your app whether a Safari app extension is loaded. (macOS)

- Allows the user to share cookies and website data between an app and Safari for a single sign-on (SSO) experience with SFAuthenticationSession.
