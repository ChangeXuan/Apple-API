# AudioUnit
### Add sophisticated audio manipulation and processing capabilities to your app. Create audio unit extensions that generate or modify audio in a host app.
## 概述
The Audio Unit framework provides interfaces for hosting either version 2 or version 3 audio units and implementing version 3 audio processing plug-ins known as Audio Unit extensions. Developers implementing version 3 audio units should subclass the AUAudioUnit class.

Version 3 Audio Unit extensions can be used on iOS, tvOS, and macOS by host apps and distributed via the App Store.
