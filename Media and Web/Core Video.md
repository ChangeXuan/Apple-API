# Core Video 
### Process digital video--including manipulation of individual frames--using a pipeline-based API and support for both Metal and OpenGL
## 概述
Core Video provides a pipeline model for digital video. It simplifies working with video by partitioning the process into discrete steps. This makes it easier for developers to access and manipulate individual frames without having to worry about translating between data types or display synchronization issues. Apps that don't need to manipulate individual video frames should never need to use Core Video directly.
