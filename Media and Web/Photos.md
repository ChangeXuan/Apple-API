## 概述
In iOS and macOS, the Photos framework provides classes that support building photo editing extensions for the Photos app. In iOS and tvOS, the Photos framework also provides direct access to the photo and video assets managed by the Photos app, including the iCloud Photo Library. Use this framework to retrieve assets for display and playback, edit their image or video content, or work with collections of assets such as albums, moments, and iCloud Shared Albums.
