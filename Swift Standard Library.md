# Swift Standard Library
### Solve complex problems and write high-performance, readable code.
## 概述
The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs, including:
- Fundamental data types such as Int, Double, and String
- Common data structures such as Array, Dictionary, and Set
- Global functions such as print(_:separator:terminator:) and abs(_:)
- Protocols, such as Collection and Equatable, that describe common abstractions.
- Protocols, such as CustomDebugStringConvertible and CustomReflectable, that you use to customize operations that are available to all types.
- Protocols, such as OptionSet, that you use to provide implementations that would otherwise require boilerplate code.
