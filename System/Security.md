# Security
### Secure the data your app manages, and control access to your app.
## 概述
Use the Security framework to protect information, establish trust, and control access to software. Broadly, security services support these goals:

- Establish a user’s identity (authentication) and then selectively grant access to resources (authorization).

- Secure data, both on disk and in motion across a network connection.

- Ensure the validity of code to be executed for a particular purpose.
