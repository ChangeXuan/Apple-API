# SecurityFoundation
### Restrict a user's access to particular feateure in your Mac app or daemon.
## 概述
This document was previously titled Authorization Services Objective-C Reference, and it replaced the SFAuthorization chapter of the Security Objective-C API document. The other chapters of that document have been replaced by SecurityInterface.

The Security Foundation framework contains a single Objective-C class, SFAuthorization, which allows you to restrict a user’s access to particular features in your Mac app or daemon.
