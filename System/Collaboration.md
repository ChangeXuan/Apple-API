# Collaboration 
### Find and access identities, that is, users and groups. Display the Identity Picker, which lets users create and select identities.
## 概述
The Collaboration framework is a set of Objective-C classes that allows developers to monitor identities and their attributes. Identities reside in an identity authority, which can be either local to a user’s system, or on a network directory. The Collaboration framework also manages a sheet, known as the identity picker, to allow applications to select identities.

The Collaboration framework works closely with the Core Services Identity APIs to form the Identity Services technology.
