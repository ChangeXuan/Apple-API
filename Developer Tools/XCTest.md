# XCTest
### Create and run unit tests, performance tests, and UI tests for your Xcode project.
## 概述
Use the XCTest framework to write unit tests for your Xcode projects that integrate seamlessly with Xcode's testing workflow.

Tests assert that certain conditions are satisfied during code execution, and record test failures (with optional messages) if those conditions are not satisfied. Tests can also measure the performance of blocks of code to check for performance regressions, and can interact with an application's UI to validate user interaction flows.
