### Create extensions to add commands to the Xcode source editor
## 概述
Using the XcodeKit framework, you can customize Xcode with source editor extensions to add functionality and specialized behavior to the source editor. Source editor extensions provide a group of editor commands alongside the built-in commands in the Editor menu in Xcode. Source editor extensions can read and modify the contents of a source file, as well as read and modify the current text selection within the editor. Include source editor extensions in developer apps distributed on the Mac App Store.
